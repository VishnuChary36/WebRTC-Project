## Quick Fix for Mobile QR Code Issues

### Step 1: Find Your Computer's IP Address
Your computer's IP addresses are:
- `172.21.160.1` (Docker/WSL network)
- `172.20.217.125` (WiFi network)

### Step 2: Mobile Access URLs
Try these URLs on your mobile device:

**HTTPS (Recommended for camera access):**
- `https://172.20.217.125:3443/mobile`
- `https://172.21.160.1:3443/mobile`

**HTTP (Fallback):**
- `http://172.20.217.125:3000/mobile`
- `http://172.21.160.1:3000/mobile`

### Step 3: Troubleshooting

#### If QR Code Doesn't Work:
1. **Manual URL Entry**: Type the URL directly in your mobile browser
2. **Network Check**: Ensure both devices are on the same WiFi network
3. **Certificate Warning**: For HTTPS, accept the security warning (self-signed certificate)

#### If Camera Doesn't Start:
1. **Use HTTPS**: Mobile browsers require HTTPS for camera access
2. **Allow Permissions**: Grant camera permissions when prompted
3. **Try Different Browser**: Chrome/Safari work best

#### If Connection Fails:
1. **Firewall**: Check Windows Firewall isn't blocking ports 3000/3443
2. **Network**: Ensure mobile and laptop are on same WiFi
3. **Docker**: Verify container is running: `docker compose ps`

### Step 4: Test Connection
1. Open desktop version: `http://localhost:3000`
2. Scan QR code or manually enter mobile URL
3. Accept certificate warning on mobile
4. Grant camera permissions
5. Start camera on mobile device

### Alternative Testing
If QR code still doesn't work, try:
1. **Direct IP**: `https://[YOUR_IP]:3443/mobile`
2. **Mobile hotspot**: Connect laptop to phone's hotspot
3. **Different network**: Try different WiFi network

## Success Indicators
âœ… Desktop shows QR code with correct IP
âœ… Mobile can access the URL (even with certificate warning)
âœ… Mobile camera permissions granted
âœ… Video stream appears on mobile device
âœ… Object detection works on mobile

## Need Help?
- Check Docker logs: `docker compose logs -f`
- Verify IP: `ipconfig` (Windows) or `ifconfig` (Mac/Linux)
- Test desktop first: `http://localhost:3000`
